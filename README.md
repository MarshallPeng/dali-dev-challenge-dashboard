# dali dev challenge dashboard - Marshall Peng 2/10/19

Thank you so much for taking the time to review my code! I had a ton of fun working on this project. I look forward to hearing back from you!

## Features

This basic web app features two main components. A profiles page, and the home page.

- The home page simply includes a map showing where all the DALI members are from and a list of links to their profiles.
- The profiles page simply displays the name, profile picture, projects, terms on, and quote.

### Technologies used

- Angular 7
- am4charts

## If I had more time

1. The appearance is pretty gross. I would have liked to make it look a little nicer. Especially the huge list of names at the bottom of the Home page, as well as the color scheme.

   - I would have liked to maybe make cards/buttons for each person, laid out in an orderly fashion. which would then take you to a more detailed profile page.

2. Thankfully, the scope of this project was relatively small, so this point isn't exactly needed, but had this project been larger, I would have liked to write unit tests and incorporate continuous integration.

3. With respect to my git workflow, I ideally would have gotten code reviews in before making pull requests, but that would be outside the scope of this project.

4. Given that I started really late, there are things that I could have abstracted, which would have made my life easier in the long run that I didn't get a chance to. I do recognize many (but definitely not all) of these inefficiencies. These sorts of inefficiencies would not be present in a formal project of mine if I had more time.

# Getting started

1. Go to project folder and install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:

```sh
npm start
```

# Main tasks

Task automation is based on [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).

| Task                                            | Description                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm start`                                     | Run development server on `http://localhost:4200/`                                                               |
| `npm run build [-- --configuration=production]` | Lint code and build web app for production (with [AOT](https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler)) in `dist/` folder |
| `npm test`                                      | Run unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) in watch mode                                         |
| `npm run test:ci`                               | Lint code and run unit tests once for continuous integration                                                     |
| `npm run e2e`                                   | Run e2e tests using [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org)                                                  |
| `npm run lint`                                  | Lint code                                                                                                        |
| `npm run translations:extract`                  | Extract strings from code and templates to `src/app/translations/template.json`                                  |
| `npm run docs`                                  | Display project documentation                                                                                    |
| `npm run prettier`                              | Automatically format all `.ts`, `.js` & `.scss` files                                                            |

When building the application, you can specify the target configuration using the additional flag
`--configuration <name>` (do not forget to prepend `--` to pass arguments to npm scripts).

The default build configuration is `prod`.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm run generate -- component <name>` to generate a new component. You can also use
`npm run generate -- directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

If you have installed [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally with `npm install -g @angular/cli`,
you can also use the command `ng generate` directly.

## Additional tools

Tasks are mostly based on the `angular-cli` tool. Use `ng help` to get more help or go check out the
[Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Code formatting

All `.ts`, `.js` & `.scss` files in this project are formatted automatically using [Prettier](https://prettier.io),
and enforced via the `test:ci` script.

A pre-commit git hook has been configured on this project to automatically format staged files, using
(pretty-quick)[https://github.com/azz/pretty-quick], so you don't have to care for it.

You can also force code formatting by running the command `npm run prettier`.
