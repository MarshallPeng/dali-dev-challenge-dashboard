    Welcome to my Application Supplement for DALI. I had a ton of fun with this project, though I probably should have
    given myself more time than just six hours before the deadline. Here is a quick explanation of what this webapp can
    do. Below, you will see a map with the locations of all the DALI members. If you scroll down even further, you will
    see a massive list of links. Clicking on these links will take you to a profile page for that member. Please see my
    README for further discussion of my implementation choices, design, and what I would have liked to change if I had
    more time.
